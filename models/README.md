Models
====

This directory contains all the custom 3D models used for our robot. The chassis is a fully optimized, super small design with sharp servo steering, while additional sensor mounts were created in Tinkercad. The rear assembly is adapted to work with LEGO wheels, axles, and a reinforced differential. Below is a table of our 3D-printed parts and their functions.

| spur_gear_36t.stl | To transfer power from the 6V motors to the modified LEGO differential, we designed and 3D-printed a 36-tooth gear that fits the motor’s 3mm D-shaped shaft and meshes with the LEGO axle system. Using a 36-tooth input gear with a 24-tooth output gear, we geared it for higher speed because the motor has a low RPM and high torque. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15A_ULyuqfeW1OqZAiTphIvPfeZAlDUrT) |
| Final_Diff.stl | The LEGO differential was imported from an online CAD model into SolidWorks, then slightly reinforced by adding extra material around the mounting holes and adapted to fit our custom chassis. These modifications improve durability while maintaining smooth power transfer to the wheels under high-torque operation. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qzpYpQRpw_0YeEP1o6rX9YchPsRdpLrL) |
| Chassis_Model.stl | The chassis is a fully optimized, custom-designed base modeled in SolidWorks for a compact structure with sharp servo steering. It houses the drivetrain, electronics, and reinforced LEGO differential, forming the core of the robot. For details on iterations, component placement, and assembly, see the build documentation. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Xr69AL12gRIF-5ft7Ylq5KtJu0QJ6xsf) |
| Servo Adapter.stl | Similar to the motor adapter, our servo motor's power must also be transferred to LEGO pieces. As a result, we created a matching axle slot, which we tuned by prototyping with different dimensions, and a slot for the servo motor, which we also adjusted by creating multiple iterations. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GnTOniM03ZfWaUI5AJC966kUiUpyUSxh) |
| FINAL_DS_HOLDER.stl | A custom-made, imported 4M LEGO beam is combined with a secure holder, modeled in TinkerCAD to keep the TOF sensor rigid and immovable. The holder eliminates any shifting or vibration, ensuring consistent and accurate sensor readings. Its LEGO integration allows for straightforward attachment to the structure while maintaining a locked, stable position. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1M6zluK-iLSjezei6UIyS69u5_PhCzkHq) |
