Models
====

This directory contains all the custom 3D models used for our robot. The chassis is a fully optimized, super small design with sharp servo steering, while additional sensor mounts were created in Tinkercad. The rear assembly is adapted to work with LEGO wheels, axles, and a reinforced differential. Below is a table of our 3D-printed parts and their functions. (The iterations of the robot, how all the electrical components and 3d models fit with robot and the purpose and optimization of each piece will be described in BUILD)

| spur_gear_36t.stl | To transfer power from the 6V motors to the modified LEGO differential, we designed and 3D-printed a 36-tooth gear that fits the motorâ€™s 3mm D-shaped shaft and meshes with the LEGO axle system. Using a 36-tooth input gear with a 24-tooth output gear, we geared it for higher speed because the motor has a low RPM and high torque. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15A_ULyuqfeW1OqZAiTphIvPfeZAlDUrT) |
| Final_Diff.stl | The LEGO differential was imported from an online CAD model into SolidWorks, then slightly reinforced by adding extra material around the mounting holes and adapted to fit our custom chassis. These modifications improve durability while maintaining smooth power transfer to the wheels under high-torque operation. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qzpYpQRpw_0YeEP1o6rX9YchPsRdpLrL) |
| Chassis_Model.stl | The chassis is a fully optimized, custom-designed base modeled in SolidWorks for a compact structure with sharp servo steering. It houses the drivetrain, electronics, and reinforced LEGO differential, forming the core of the robot. For details on iterations, component placement, and assembly, see the build documentation. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Xr69AL12gRIF-5ft7Ylq5KtJu0QJ6xsf) |
| Steering_Connecting_Bar.stl | The steering connecting bar is a compact, custom-designed link optimized for the sharp servo steering system of the WRO Future Engineers self-driving car. Modeled in SolidWorks, it features recessed screw inlets that improve grip and durability, ensuring a secure fit while transferring motion smoothly between steering components. Its minimal, lightweight design makes it both efficient and reliable under high steering loads. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1eNLU3cQQbzHstJQHPj6PBz5TVGXz-ltt) |
| FINAL_DS_HOLDER.stl | A custom-made, imported 4M LEGO beam is combined with a secure holder, modeled in TinkerCAD to keep the TOF sensor rigid and immovable. The holder eliminates any shifting or vibration, ensuring consistent and accurate sensor readings. Its LEGO integration allows for straightforward attachment to the structure while maintaining a locked, stable position. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1M6zluK-iLSjezei6UIyS69u5_PhCzkHq) |
