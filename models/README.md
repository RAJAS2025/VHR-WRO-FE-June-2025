Models
====

This directory contains all the custom 3D models used for our robot. The chassis is a fully optimized, super small design with sharp servo steering, while additional sensor mounts were created in Tinkercad. The rear assembly is adapted to work with LEGO wheels, axles, and a reinforced differential. Below is a table of our 3D-printed parts and their functions.

| spur_gear_36t.stl | To transfer power from the 6V motors to the modified LEGO differential, we designed and 3D-printed a 36-tooth gear that fits the motor’s 3mm D-shaped shaft and meshes with the LEGO axle system. Using a 36-tooth input gear with a 24-tooth output gear, we geared it for higher speed while taking advantage of the motor’s low RPM and high torque. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1E4202c6R0TsrAaZ3BQW_tvwbldiSIvys) |
| Motor Mount.stl | With motor stability being a crucial part of our drivetrain, we needed to create our own mount to properly secure the motors to our chassis. This helps with our robot's balance and evens out the centre of gravity by allowing us to place one motor on opposite sides. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1D0yKnxFAW6SQvOJ0TEjyHxbqPvfBbSil) |
| Motor Bracket.stl | This piece has similar functionality to our motor mounts, except it required a different shape due to where it was placed in our robot. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EIdGw3D41y_rZrJ51rGCMfyTHQfU-PNn) |
| Servo Adapter.stl | Similar to the motor adapter, our servo motor's power must also be transferred to LEGO pieces. As a result, we created a matching axle slot, which we tuned by prototyping with different dimensions, and a slot for the servo motor, which we also adjusted by creating multiple iterations. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GnTOniM03ZfWaUI5AJC966kUiUpyUSxh) |
| Servo Mount.stl | Our servo motor needed to be secure in order to have crisp steering and minimal unwanted movement. To achieve this, we modelled a mount for the servo motor that would attach to our chassis and also contain a slot that perfectly fits the servo motor. | ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1F96VgjeS6cWsnzOnpm562NX8wrUOuewb) |
