This directory documents the materials used to construct our robot, along with the reasoning behind our drivetrain, gearing, and steering choices. It also includes the design iterations, comparisons between old and new robots, the CAD process, and how electrical components, 3D-printed parts, VEX pieces, and LEGO elements were integrated into our fully 3D-printed chassis. An assembly video is also provided to demonstrate how the robot comes together.
## New Drivetrain & Chassis Design

Our robot is a four-wheeled vehicle that uses a **rear-wheel drive with sharp front-wheel servo steering**. The chassis was custom-modeled in SolidWorks for a compact, lightweight structure that minimizes complexity while maximizing reliability. By separating the steering system from the drivetrain, we avoided issues with spacing and ensured that the steering servo and the drive motors operate independently without interference. This gave us two possible configurations: front-wheel drive with rear steering or rear-wheel drive with front steering.  

We chose the **rear-wheel drive with front steering** configuration because it provides several advantages:  
- **More precise steering**, since the front wheels focus only on steering.  
- **Balanced handling**, with weight distributed between front and rear.  
- **No torque steer**, unlike front-wheel drive systems.  
- **Stronger traction under acceleration**, as weight shifts to the rear drive wheels.  
- **Better power handling**, making it suitable for higher torque motors.  
- **Familiar control response**, matching our previous experience with other rear-driven LEGO robots.   

This design results in a simple, efficient, and reliable drivetrain well-suited for our competition needs.

## Old Drivetrain & Chassis Design & Differences of both & Why we switched

Our old robot also used a rear-wheel drive system with the same advantages. However, it was built mostly from LEGO pieces, making it bulkier and less optimized. The drivetrain design placed the motor vertically at the back, which consumed a lot of space.
